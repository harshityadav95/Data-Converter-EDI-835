## File Structure:
- converter.py: Main file for user interaction and calling the conversion process.
- segment_parser.py: Handles parsing EDI segments and their elements.
- loop_builder.py: Builds hierarchical loop structures from the parsed segments.
- transaction_set_builder.py: Constructs the complete transaction set representation.
- edi_to_json.py: Converts the EDI transaction set to JSON format.
- json_to_edi.py: Converts a JSON representation back to EDI format.
- utilities.py: Contains helper functions (e.g., for delimiter handling).


## segment_parser.py

- split_segment Function (from utilities.py): This function will be defined in utilities.py. 
- It's responsible for splitting the segment into its elements based on the correct delimiter (either '*' or '|'). We'll define this helper function in the last file.
parse Method: This method takes an EDI segment as input and returns a dictionary where:
- The key is the segment identifier (e.g., 'CLP', 'NM1', 'SVC').
- The value is a list of the data elements within that segment.

```
parser = SegmentParser()
parsed_segment = parser.parse('CLP*CLAIM123*1*125.00')
print(parsed_segment)  # Output: {'CLP': ['CLAIM123', '1', '125.00']} 
```


## loop_builder.py
Alright, here's the code for **`loop_builder.py`** (file 3). This file is crucial for constructing the hierarchical loop structures that represent the relationships between different EDI segments within the 835.

**Explanation:**

1. **`loop_start_identifiers`:** A list of segment identifiers that mark the beginning of a loop in the EDI 835 structure.
2. **`loop_end_identifier`:** The segment identifier that signals the end of a loop (`'SE'`).
3. **`build` Method:**
    - **`loop_stack`:** A stack to keep track of open loops. Each loop on the stack is a list of dictionaries (parsed segments within the loop).
    - **`result`:**  A list to store the final loop structure.
    - The method iterates through the segments:
        - If the segment starts a new loop, a new empty loop is pushed onto the `loop_stack`.
        - If the segment is an `'SE'`, the top loop is popped from the stack, and either added to the parent loop (if there's a parent loop on the stack) or to the `result` list (if it's the outermost loop).
        - Otherwise, the parsed segment is added to the current loop on the top of the `loop_stack`. 

**Example:**

```python
segments = [
    'ISA*...',
    'GS*...',
    'ST*835*...',
    'BPR*...',
    'LX*1~',
    'CLP*...',
    'NM1*...', 
    'SVC*...',
    'SE*...',
    'GE*...',
    'IEA*...'
]

builder = LoopBuilder()
loop_structure = builder.build(iter(segments))
print(loop_structure) 
```

The output would be a nested list of dictionaries representing the loop structure of the EDI 835. 

Okay, here's file 4, **`transaction_set_builder.py`**, which uses the loop structure created in `loop_builder.py` to build the complete representation of the EDI 835 transaction set.

## transaction_set_builder.py

**Explanation:**

1. **`build` Method:** 
   - Uses the `LoopBuilder` to get the hierarchical loop structure of the EDI segments.
   - Iterates through the loop structure, building the `interchange`, `financial_information`, `claims`, and `organizations` objects.
2. **`_build_attribute` Method:** 
   - A helper method to extract and create the appropriate objects based on the segment identifier. 
3. **`TransactionSet` Class:**
   - Holds the complete parsed EDI 835 transaction set:
      - `interchange`: The Interchange segment.
      - `financial_information`: The financial information segment.
      - `claims`: A list of parsed `Claim` objects. 
      - `organizations`: A list of `Organization` objects representing the payer and payee.

This setup makes it easy to access specific information from the parsed EDI 835 file (e.g., `transaction_set.payer.organization.name` would give you the payer's name).

Here's the code for **`edi_to_json.py`** (file 5). This file contains the functionality to convert the parsed EDI 835 representation (built in the previous files) into a JSON string.

## edi_to_json.py 


**Explanation:**

1. **`edi_to_json` Function:**
   - Reads the EDI 835 data from the file.
   - Uses the `TransactionSetBuilder` to create a `TransactionSet` object.
   - Calls `json.dumps` with a custom serializer (`_custom_serializer`) to convert the `TransactionSet` into a JSON string.
   - The `indent=4` argument in `json.dumps` makes the output JSON pretty-printed. 

2. **`_custom_serializer` Function:**
   - This function is essential for handling custom objects (like the `TransactionSet`, `ClaimLoop`, etc.) during the JSON serialization. 
   - It checks the type of the object and:
      - If it's a custom object, it returns its `__dict__` (its attributes).
      - If it's a list or tuple, it recursively calls itself to serialize the elements.
      - If it's a type it doesn't know how to serialize, it raises a `TypeError`.

**Example:**

```python
json_output = edi_to_json('path/to/your/edi_file.835')
print(json_output)
```

This will print the JSON representation of your EDI 835 file. 
 

You're right, we still need to be able to convert JSON back to EDI. Here's the code for **`json_to_edi.py`** (file 6):

## json_to_edi.py 

**Explanation:**

1. **`json_to_edi` function:** 
   - Loads the JSON data.
   - Uses the `_build_transaction_set` helper function to reconstruct the `TransactionSet` object.
   - Iterates through the structure of the `TransactionSet` object, converting each segment back to its EDI string representation (using the `to_edi` methods of each segment).
   - Finally, it joins the segments with the '~' delimiter to form the complete EDI string.

2. **Helper Functions (`_build_transaction_set`, `_build_claim`, `_build_service`, `_build_organization`):**
   - These functions are used to reconstruct the `TransactionSet` object and its nested components (ClaimLoop, ServiceLoop, etc.) from the JSON data. 
   - They use the `from_dict` methods of each segment class (which you'll define in the corresponding segment files) to build the segments from their dictionary representations.

**Example:**

```python
with open('path/to/your/json_file.json', 'r') as f:
    json_data = f.read()

edi_output = json_to_edi(json_data)
print(edi_output)
```

This will print the EDI 835 representation of the data in your JSON file.

You're right! Here's **`utilities.py`** (file 7) which will contain our helper function for segment splitting.

**utilities.py (file 7):**


**Explanation:**

1. **`split_segment` function:**
   - Takes an EDI segment string as input.
   - Splits the segment based on the provided `segment_delimiter`, which defaults to '*'.
   - Returns a list of the segment's data elements.

2. **`find_identifier` function:**
   - Takes an EDI segment as input (either a string or a dictionary).
   - If it's a string, it splits the segment and returns the first element, which is the segment identifier.
   - If it's a dictionary, it assumes the key is the identifier and returns the key.

**Important Notes:**

* **Complete the `to_edi()` Methods:** You need to define `to_edi()` methods in all your segment classes (`Interchange`, `FinancialInformation`, `Claim`, `Service`, `Entity`, `Reference`, etc.) to convert those objects back to EDI strings. These methods should reverse the parsing logic you implemented in each segment class.

* **Error Handling:**  This code doesn't have much error handling (e.g., for invalid JSON). You should add robust error handling to make your parser more reliable.

* **EDI Codes:** The conversion back to EDI might require you to look up certain codes (like claim adjustment reason codes). You'll need to maintain a dictionary of these codes or use an external library that provides them.
